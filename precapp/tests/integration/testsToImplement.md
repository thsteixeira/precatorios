Now let me check what specific tests are currently implemented to give you a precise answer:

Based on my analysis of the current integration tests and the comprehensive strategy document, let me give you a clear and honest answer:

Current Coverage: Partial Implementation
The short answer is: NO, not yet completely. Here's the precise breakdown:

✅ WHAT IS FULLY COVERED (9 tests passing)
Administrative/Customization Workflows:
✅ Customization: Create, edit, delete phases (regular + honorários)
✅ Customization: Diligencia type management
✅ Customization: System statistics and configuration
✅ Customization: Cross-module administrative integration
🔧 WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS FIXING (7 tests failing)
Core Business Workflows:
🔧 Precatorio: Creation + client linking workflows (P001, P002, P007)
🔧 Cliente: Creation + precatorio linking workflows (C001)
🔧 Alvara: Creation from precatorio detail page (A001)
🔧 Requerimento: Creation from precatorio detail page (R001)
🔧 Complete Integration: End-to-end business scenarios
Status: Tests are written but have form validation and redirect issues that need debugging.

❌ WHAT IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
Missing CRUD Operations:
Functionality	Create	Read	Update	Delete
Precatorio	🔧	❌	❌	❌
Cliente	🔧	❌	❌	❌
Requerimento	🔧	❌	❌	❌
Alvara	🔧	❌	❌	❌
Customization	✅	✅	✅	✅
Missing Advanced Workflows:
Search/Filter operations across all modules
Bulk operations (multiple deletes, bulk updates)
Error handling scenarios
Complex business rules validation
Performance testing with large datasets
Security testing across all operations
📊 Coverage Summary by Functionality
1. 🏛️ Precatorio: ~15% covered

4. 📜 Alvara: ~15% covered
✅ Basic creation workflow (implementation needs debugging)
✅ Honorários phase integration (working in admin tests)
❌ Edit/update workflows
❌ Delete workflows
❌ Search/filter workflows
5. ⚙️ Customization: ~90% covered ✅
✅ Phase management (create, edit, delete)
✅ Honorários phase management
✅ Diligencia type management
✅ System statistics and configuration
✅ Cross-module integration
🎯 What You Have vs. Strategic Plan
Strategic Plan Coverage: 50+ specific workflows identified
Currently Implemented: ~16 workflows (9 working + 7 needing fixes)
Overall Progress: ~30% complete
💡 Recommendation
You have an excellent foundation with:

Complete administrative coverage (working perfectly)
Systematic testing architecture in place
Comprehensive strategic plan
Core business workflows implemented (just need debugging)
Next logical steps:

Fix the 7 failing core business tests (highest priority)
Add the missing CRUD operations systematically
Implement remaining workflows according to the strategic plan
You're about 30% of the way to complete coverage, but you have the hardest part done - the architecture and framework are solid!
